Definition List
---------------
This component might seem confusing at first.
However, it merely emulates the behavior of
 the <dl> element, with some additional benefits.
The structure is very well-defined here, which makes things
 like type-checking and styling easier for consumers.
For example, it puts groups of <dd>/<dt> pairings
 into <div>'s for easier styling.

WARNING!
The current naive implementation of this component may be
 a bit slow, and could cause excessive re-renders.

TODO!
To fix this issue, use react state and hooks to help.
It may also be pertinent to fix the div keys for this, too.
