# CSS Variables & SASS Placeholders
Where possible, I've used CSS Variables throughout the style system.
However, they can't hold values for multiple properties easily, unless using certain shorthands.
Therefore, some SASS placeholders are also used in these cases.
For example, some placeholders made for convenience are placed in "placeholders.scss".
